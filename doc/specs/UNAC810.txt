;
;           This system allows playback of 8-bit 10000 Hz mono
;           PCM audio. The code on the CPU must time the sent samples
;           properly by sending a sample every 0.1 milliseconds
;           (Univtek 020 runs at 2 MHz, so every 200 cycles).
;
;       A = 0:            ENABLE OR DISABLE
;           The DAC Is disabled if B = 0, or enabled otherwise.
;           By default, it is disabled.
;
;       A = 1:            SET SAMPLE
;           Sets the current sample. The samples must be timed
;           properly, sent every 0.1 milliseconds. The sample rate,
,           depth or number of channels cannot be changed.
;           There is no buffer, so the samples must be timed exactly.
;           Only the low 8 bits of the register B are read.
;
;           Returns:
;                Nothing

while this emulator may have a buffer,
    it is an implementation detail.
