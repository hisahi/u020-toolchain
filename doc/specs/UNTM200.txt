Univtek Timer (UNTM200)
;

;        ID:             0x8f1705a6
;        Version:         0xc801
;        Manufacturer:    0x2590a31c (UNIVTEK_CORP)
;
;            This timer allows creating counters that increase every
;            N cycles as well as interrupts every cycle.
;
;        A = 0:            SET INTERVAL
;            The B and C registers are read. The timer will tick
;            every C*65536 + B cycles, or if B and C are 0, the timer
;            is disabled. The internal counter is reset to 0.
;
;            Since Univtek 020 runs at 2 MHz, a single cycle is roughly
;            every 0.5 microseconds. However, the precision can only
;            be guaranteed above 20 cycle intervals (>= 10 Âµs).
;
;            Returns:
;                Nothing
;
;        A = 1:            GET COUNTER
;            Polls the internal counter and returns the value in the
;            C register: the number of ticks since the last call to
;            A = 0 or A = 1.
;            THE COUNTER IS RESET AFTER THIS CALL.
;
;            Returns:
;                C = internal counter
;
;        A = 2:            SET INTERRUPT MESSAGES
;            If B = 0, interrupts are disabled.
;
;            If B is nonzero, it is set as the interrupt message and
;            interrupts will be triggered when ticks occur.
;
;            Usually, a tick will occur every interrupt, but
;            it is still advised to check with A = 1 for the
;            amount of ticks since last interrupt.
;
;            Returns:
;                Nothing
;
;        A = 3:            GET INTERVAL
;            Returns the last interval set to A = 0 in B and C.
;
;            Returns:
;                B, C = timer interval
;
;       
; Implementation detail: Interrupts will only happen every so often.
